# Position Tracking (Planned)

Accurate position tracking enables proportional sells and clean PnL reporting when balances change over time.

Planned components:
- Trades collection (BUY/SELL with market, outcome, size, price, timestamp)
- Position aggregation per market/outcome
- Proportional sell engine that mirrors trader exits
- Realized vs unrealized PnL breakdown
