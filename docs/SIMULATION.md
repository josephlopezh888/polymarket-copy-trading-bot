# Simulation (Scaffold)

This repository includes placeholders for a simulation/backtesting workflow. You can implement your data provider and PnL logic, then run scenarios to evaluate parameters like `TRADE_MULTIPLIER` and polling frequency.

Suggested steps:
- Implement history fetchers for tracked traders and markets
- Reconstruct sequences of buys/sells and prices
- Apply your sizing rules and transaction costs
- Measure PnL, drawdown, win-rate, and capacity limits
